# CNN-Sentiment-Analysis

This project uses nltk’s Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER) sentiment analysis model to determine the positivity/negativity of tweets from CNN’s official twitter account. The tweets were scraped from @CNN using tweepy, processed in excel and python (using regex and libraries like pandas), and separated into sentences for nltk’s anaylsis. Visualizations were created using Altair.
